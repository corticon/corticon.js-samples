These directory contain all the assets for the Solar panel installation and loans demonstration.

The "Client UI" directory contains the HTML client.
The "Step Functions Assets" contains the definition of the state machine (the step functions), the associated Lambda functions
as well as the Corticon.js decision services rules set and rule flows.

Note: some of the index.js Lambda functions generated by Corticon.js are customized to manipulate the payload coming from the
previous step.  The modified index.js are available in "Customized DS Lambda Entry Points".
If you update the decision service and redeploy to AWS Lambda using the zip file the index.js will be overwritten,
please be sure to only upload the decision service bundle file (decisionServiceBundle.js).
