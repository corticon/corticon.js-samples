Why we have these folders: 

These sub-directories contain the customized version of the index.js Lambda functions generated by Corticon.js
The files were customized to manipulate the payload coming from the previous step.

Intent:

When you update any decision service and redeploy to AWS Lambda using the newly generated zip file (Package Rules for Deployment menu in studio) 
the index.js is overwritten.  The files in this folder can be used to restore index.js to the proper version.

You have 2 options:
- Replace the decision service bundle file in the Lambda function (copy and paste decisionServiceBundle.js content directly into AWS code editor) 
- Upload the generated zip file and then replace index.js with the saved copy at CompositeApps/AWS Step Functions/Solar Installation/Step Functions Assets/Decision Services/Customized DS Lambda Entry Points
