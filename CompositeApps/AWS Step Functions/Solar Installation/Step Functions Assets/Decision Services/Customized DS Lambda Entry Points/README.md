Why we have these folders: 

These sub-directories contain the customized version of the index.js Lambda functions generated by Corticon.js
The files were customized to manipulate the payload coming from the previous step.

With Corticon V1.0 we didn't pass through data that did not belong to rules. So we had to customize 
all the index.js files.  However as of Corticon V1.1, all data is passed through, so the only
custom step is for the solar savings rulesheet.  The entry point for that rulesheet needs to create the payload from the output 
of a parallel step (that is it receives an array of 2 payloads and it needs to merge them.
See the comments in index.js for more details. 

Intent:

When you update any decision service and redeploy to AWS Lambda using the newly generated zip file (Package Rules for Deployment menu in studio) 
the index.js is overwritten.  The files in this folder can be used to restore index.js to the proper version.

You have 2 options:
- Replace the decision service bundle file in the Lambda function (copy and paste decisionServiceBundle.js content directly into AWS code editor) 
- Upload the generated zip file and then replace index.js with the saved copy at CompositeApps/AWS Step Functions/Solar Installation/Step Functions Assets/Decision Services/Customized DS Lambda Entry Points
