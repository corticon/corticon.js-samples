This directory contains the customized version of the index.js Lambda functions generated by Corticon.js
The files were customized to manipulate the payload coming from the previous step.
If you have updated the decision service and redeployed to AWS Lambda using the zip file the index.js is overwritten.  The files
in this folder can be used to restore index.js to the proper version.

To avoid that situation, we recommend to only upload the decision service bundle file (decisionServiceBundle.js) instead of the zip file.
