This directory contains the generated decision services and the customized version of the 
index.js Lambda functions generated by Corticon.js

The intent is to provide the initial zip files ready to upload to newly created Lambda functions (if you want to recreate a an AWS step function state machine).  
But if you modify any rules, you will need to regenerate the decision services and update the Lambda functions. 
 
The index.js files were customized to manipulate the payload coming from the previous step.
When you update any decision service and redeploy to AWS Lambda using the zip file 
the index.js is overwritten. 

You have 2 options:
- Replace the decision service bundle file in the Lambda function (copy and paste decisionServiceBundle.js content directly into AWS code editor) 
- Upload the generated zip file and then replace index.js with the saved copy at CompositeApps/AWS Step Functions/Solar Installation/Step Functions Assets/Decision Services/Customized DS Lambda Entry Points
