NativeScript Mobile Sample

Example of a car rental application. Select a car, to then get a quote on the additional insurance rate depending on driver details. 

It contains the NativeScript app, the compiled CorticonJS bundle and the Corticon Rules project.

I've also added an APK for trying it out without installing a NativeScript build stack.
