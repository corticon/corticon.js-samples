# Corticon.js Samples
This repository contains sample decision services for using [Corticon.js](https://www.progress.com/corticon-js) across a variety of JavaScript environments.

With Corticon.js, you can deploy rules to any platform that supports a compatible version of JavaScript. With this flexibility, you automate decisions where the data originates from or where the decisions have the most effect. Supported deployments of Corticon.js include:

- Rules deployed as serverless functions on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Microsoft Azure Functions
- Rules integrated into a cloud work flow such as AWS Step Functions, Microsoft Flow/Logic Apps, or Google Workflows
- Rules run on your own back end as part of your node.js platform
- Rules bundled in a mobile app created with Xamarin, React, Vue.js, or other toolkits
- Rules executed in a browser as part of a web application
- Rules executed in a browser which define a dynamic form's UI behavior
