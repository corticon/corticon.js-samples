## What is Corticon.js?

Corticon.js is a powerful rules engine that allows you to define, deploy, and execute business rules as JavaScript. With Corticon.js, you can automate decision-making processes by embedding rules directly into your applications, whether they run in the browser, on mobile devices, or in serverless/cloud environments.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Deploy rules to any platform that supports JavaScript.
