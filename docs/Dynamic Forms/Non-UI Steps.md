Executing Steps with No UI to Render

Sometimes the Decision Service needs to execute a stage with no associated UI to rende. For example, the Decision Service might need to execute business logic and then move to next step.

This is implemented by the Decision Service in the attribute UI.noUiToRenderContinue (a boolean).
