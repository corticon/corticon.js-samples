# Localization

Corticon Studio enables you to localize Vocabulary terms. This is useful if there are multiple rule modelers who are responsible for developing or maintaining the rule model and they speak different languages.

To localize Vocabulary terms, you open the Localization panel (select Vocabulary > Localize), select the desired language or languages in the Locale section of the panel, and then manually enter the localized word for each term as shown in this image.&#x20;
