# Unique Considerations when Building Rules for Dynamic Forms Rules

In a typical decision automation use case, rulesheets and ruleflows are 'connected' from one to another when constructing the top level ruleflow. Connections are the objects that connect or “stitch” assets and objects together to control their sequence of execution.

If a connector is drawn from Rulesheet `sample1.ers` to `sample2.ers`, then when a deployed Ruleflow is invoked, it will execute the rules in `sample1.ers` first, followed by the rules in `sample2.ers`.

For dynamic forms however, instead of a decision that will always go through the same chronology during a single execution, dynamic forms require the ability to navigate throughout the objects in a ruleflow, such that different rules may fire at different times, depending upon dynamic variables. For example, the sequence may be determined based upon:

-   Data that the end user has entered to that point (e.g. to route to different parts of a ruleflow depending upon what type of claim a user has chosen to file)
-    Whether any data is pre-populated at the start of a ruleflow (e.g. leveraging account information specific to the end user as part of the decision for what gets presented in the form)
