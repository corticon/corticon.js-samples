# Testing the Rules

A *Ruletest* simulates a business scenario where the rules are applied to input data. If the data satisfies all the conditions in a rule, the rule fires and some output containing the results of the rule execution is produced.

You can define different sets of input data to test how the rules behave in different scenarios. You can also use a Ruletest to compare the output of a rule execution with expected results. A Ruletest stores this information in a Ruletest file, enabling you to save use-cases that are of interest, change rules, and run the test again to see how the modified rules behave when applied to the same use-cases.

Ruletests reproduce how the rules will behave once deployed as a decision service.
