# Organizing the Rules

From here, you can continue adding more rules to the rulesheet, or more commonly, compartmentalize our rules into different rulesheets, and create a Ruleflow to specify the sequence from one rulesheet to another.

As more rulesheets are added to our Ruleflow, Ruletests can be run against entire Ruleflows, instead of testing only the Rulesheets as they are developed. This enables you to test not only the rules as they are defined in the Rulesheet, but also how the Ruleflow works, and how the rules behave as part of the Ruleflow. This way, problems can be detected and fixed earlier in the lifecycle.
