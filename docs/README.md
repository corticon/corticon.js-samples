## What it is

Dynamic Forms are just one use case for Corticon.js. 

In a nutshell, with Corticon and Corticon.js, you use a model-driven development environment called Corticon Studio for defining rules that will change input data based upon conditions and their resulting actions. Typically, a rules engine is used for making a decision from data that is _already known and available_, for example, calculating a loan rate based upon the data known about an applicant. 

## Corticon.js vs Corticon Server

Corticon.js is the JavaScript runtime variant of Corticon, distinct from deployments onto Corticon Server. With Corticon.js, we can do many things that are less well suited for client/server applications, such as extending the afformentioned tradional use cases for rules engines into use cases where rules running on the front end define a dynamic flow of an end user form. 

## Dynamic Forms with Corticon.js

For example, consider a scenario where we want to define a form that determines an end user's income tax based upon their income and demographic characteristics. In the US, taxes are impacted by marital status. 

It's made possible by leveraging the fact that the deployable in Corticon.js is a self contained JavaScript bundle, so all rule logic can be built directly into a front end website or app to guide the rendering of the form.
