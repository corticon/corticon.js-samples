* Rules integrated into a cloud work flow such as AWS Step Functions, Microsoft Flow/Logic Apps, or Google Workflows
* Rules run on your own back end as part of your node.js platform

* Rules executed in a browser as part of a web application
* Rules executed in a browser which define a dynamic form's UI behavior
