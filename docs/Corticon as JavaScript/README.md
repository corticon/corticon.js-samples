# JavaScript Decision Services

With Corticon.js, you can deploy rules to any platform that supports a compatible version of JavaScript. With this flexibility, you automate decisions where the data originates from or where the decisions have the most effect. Supported deployments of Corticon.js include:

* Rules deployed as serverless functions on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Microsoft Azure Functions
* Rules integrated into a cloud work flow such as AWS Step Functions, Microsoft Flow/Logic Apps, or Google Workflows
* Rules run on your own back end as part of your node.js platform
* Rules bundled in a mobile app created with Xamarin, React, Vue.js, or other toolkits
* Rules executed in a browser as part of a web application
* Rules executed in a browser which define a dynamic form's UI behavior
