This for showing an SCO accessing properties from the decision service configuration.

The SCO will receive all the properties under the serviceCallout properties. For example,
for the following configuration:

const configuration = { logLevel: 0, "serviceCallout": { "prop1": "abc", "prop2": 12 } };

The SCO will be passed the object literal: { "prop1": "abc", "prop2": 12 }
