This SCO shows how to make a REST call from a Corticon decision service using data from the payload and augment the payload 
with information returned from the REST service.

Specifically, it takes medical procedure codes and return the associated reimbursement rates.
	
Important note when SCO runs in browser:
---------------------------------------
When running a decision service that uses a REST SCO within a browser, one may face cross-origin browser restrictions. 
For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. For example, XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API 
follow the same-origin policy. This means that a web application using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the application 
was loaded from unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.
	
To invoke a REST service that is running on a different host than the decision service, one needs to use cors.
	 
Here are some good read on cors:
