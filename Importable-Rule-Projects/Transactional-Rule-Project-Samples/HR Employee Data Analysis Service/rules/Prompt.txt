Decision models (similarly to databases) frequently deal with analysis of collections of objects. This monthâ€™s Challenge deals with such a situation: you need to help an HR office create a rules-based service to analyze its employees. Each employee  has a unique name,  age, gender, marital status, locations (places of residence), number of children, salary, and more attributes. This information is coming to the service as a JSON request such as in this file. Your service should find answers to questions such as:


    What is the current total number of employees?
    How many children all employees have? How many children does the average employee have?
    What is an average salary? What is the maximal and minimal salaries?
    How many employees are single?
    In which states do the employee have residences?
    How many people are inside 20% of highest paid  employees? Who are these high-paid employees?
    List employees living in certain zip codes.
